# JavaAPIInAction

This project intends to show Java API usage in stand alone sample programs with Assertions using JUnit 5 for run time exceptions, Comments for compilation errors .

Note: This is not a comprehensive coverage of Java API, it only covers some of the topics that a sample test case provides better understanding

This project allows Java learners to observe and understand Java API in action by running small test cases,
	-- Helps beginners to get better understanding of Java API and practice Java by extending this code base which can help them to put their theoretical knowledge in practice.

You are in right place if 

	-- You are looking for some sample codes to run in your local machine to observe the Java API usage working behavior in action
	-- You are looking for some Java sample code to play around 
	-- You want to get hands on with JUnit 5 Test cases
